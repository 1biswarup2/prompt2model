# 3D Model Generator from Text Prompts

## Introduction
This application utilizes the powerful capabilities of the TripoSR and Stability AI's Stable Diffusion model to generate 3D models from text prompts. Simply input your desired scene or object in text, and the app processes this into a detailed 3D model in OBJ format.

## set you key for stability ai and run the ipynb
1. Just set your your stability key in the ipynb file
2. Run the prompt2model_1.ipynb file---> Thats all !!!

## Interface
you will get an interface like--

Now you can donwload this model in OBJ format and that looks like--
